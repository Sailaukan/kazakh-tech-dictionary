# Kazakh Technical Terms Translation Platform

This project is a website where users can offer their ideas for the translation of technical terms to Kazakh. In fields like rocket science, there are many words that do not have direct translations, and this platform allows users to suggest and vote on translations. This way, new translations can be chosen by the community and used to develop the field. This idea is useful for many other fields as well.
